I submit the following for assessment as my best class.

* The method comp1110.ass2.Solution.Dancinglinks.createDancingLinks() in class comp1110.ass2.Solution.Dancinglinks.
* The method comp1110.ass2.Solution.Solution.getsolution() in class comp1110.ass2.Solution.Solution.
* The method comp1110.ass2.Solution.Dancinglinks.solve() in class comp1110.ass2.Solution.Dancinglinks.


I declare that this is entirely my own work, with the following documented exceptions:

* The idea of <comp1110.ass2.Solution.Dancinglinks> came from <comp1110/ass2/Solution/Reference/dancinglinks.pdf>

* The code in class <comp1110.ass2.Solution.Dancinglinks> uses an idea suggested by <http://garethrees.org/2007/06/10/zendoku-generation/#section-4>

##Note
Although this data structure can effectively solve this problem, in fact, I did not understand the structure deeply, but constructed it step by step according to the article and other's code.   
In the final recursive solution process, there are still something uncertain, such as  how to get a recursion can traverse all possible situations.
